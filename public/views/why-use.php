            <h1>Cookie Banner Requirements</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A cookie banner is typically required on websites to comply with data protection laws like GDPR, LGPD, and CCPA. Its purpose is to inform users about the use of cookies and to obtain their consent for non-essential cookies.</p>
                <h2>When is a banner necessary?</h2>
                <p>A banner is required if your website uses cookies for purposes such as analytics, marketing, or personalizing user preferences. These cookies require explicit user consent.</p>
                <h2>Are banners required for necessary cookies?</h2>
                <p>In most jurisdictions, such as under GDPR, LGPD, and similar laws, banners are not required if your website only uses cookies that are strictly necessary for functionality. Examples include session cookies, authentication tokens, and cookies required for security or completing purchases. These cookies do not require user consent but must still be disclosed in the site's privacy policy.</p>
                <h2>Key Notes:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GDPR:</strong> Requires consent for all cookies except those strictly necessary for functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>LGPD:</strong> Similar to GDPR, consent is needed for non-essential cookies.</li>
                    <li><strong>CCPA:</strong> Does not mandate consent banners but requires websites to inform users about data collection and provide opt-out options for data sales.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Use a banner when deploying non-essential cookies. For strictly necessary cookies, disclosure in your privacy policy is sufficient in most cases.</p>
