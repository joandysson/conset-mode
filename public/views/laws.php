            <h1>Data Privacy Laws and Google Consent Mode V2</h1>
            <article>
                <h2>GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
                <p>
                    The GDPR is the European Union’s data protection and privacy regulation. It mandates transparency, consent, and accountability in how organizations handle personal data. Under GDPR, businesses must inform users about data collection, provide opt-in consent, and ensure secure data storage. Google Consent Mode V2 aligns with GDPR by enabling websites to respect user preferences for cookies and tracking technologies.
                </p>
                <h3>How Google Consent Mode V2 Complies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows users to opt in or out of tracking cookies (analytics and ads).</li>
                    <li>Integrates with CMPs like Usercentrics to manage consent.</li>
                    <li>Automatically updates Google Tag Manager settings based on user choices.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>LGPD - Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados</h2>
                <p>
                    Brazil’s LGPD focuses on protecting the personal data of individuals. It is similar to the GDPR but tailored to the Brazilian context. The LGPD requires clear communication of data practices, user consent for non-essential cookies, and the ability to revoke consent. With Google Consent Mode V2, websites operating in Brazil can automate compliance by integrating consent management tools.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Features of Google Consent Mode V2 for LGPD:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Default consent settings to "denied" for tracking cookies until user opt-in.</li>
                    <li>Real-time updates to tracking tools based on consent status.</li>
                    <li>Helps businesses demonstrate compliance with LGPD mandates.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>CCPA - California Consumer Privacy Act</h2>
                <p>
                    The CCPA protects the privacy rights of California residents by requiring businesses to disclose their data practices and offer opt-outs for data sales. While the CCPA does not mandate opt-in consent like GDPR, it emphasizes user control. Google Consent Mode V2 supports CCPA by ensuring ad personalization and data tracking respect opt-out preferences.
                </p>
                <h3>CCPA Highlights in Google Consent Mode V2:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" requirements.</li>
                    <li>Allows businesses to limit data sharing when users opt out.</li>
                    <li>Adapts cookie behavior dynamically based on user preferences.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Other Global Privacy Laws</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond GDPR, LGPD, and CCPA, other jurisdictions have introduced privacy laws, such as Canada’s PIPEDA, Australia’s Privacy Act, and South Africa’s POPIA. While specifics differ, the principles of transparency, consent, and user rights remain universal. Google Consent Mode V2 enables a unified approach to global compliance by integrating with multiple CMPs and adapting to various legal frameworks.
                </p>
                <h3>Global Compliance with Google Consent Mode V2:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides a consistent framework for managing user consent across regions.</li>
                    <li>Supports multiple languages and configurations for diverse audiences.</li>
                    <li>Reduces the complexity of multi-jurisdictional compliance efforts.</li>
                </ul>
